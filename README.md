## List of Programs

1. **Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide** (`add_sub_mul_div.asm`): This program performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers.

2. **Bubble Sort** (`bubble_sort.asm`): This program implements the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.

3. **Array Reverse** (`array_reverse.asm`): This program reverses the elements of an array in place.

4. **Bubble Sort with Display** (`bubble_sort_display.asm`): Similar to the previous bubble sort program, but this one also displays the sorted array.

5. **Factorial Calculation** (`factorial.asm`): This program calculates the factorial of a number using a loop.

6. **Flag Register Display** (`flag_register_display.asm`): This program displays the contents of various flags in the flag register after manipulating them.

7. **GCD and LCM Calculation** (`gcd_lcm.asm`): This program calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers.

8. **Array Sorting and Palindrome Check** (`sort_and_palindrome.asm`): This program sorts an array and checks if it is a palindrome.

9. **HCF and LCM Calculation** (`hcf_lcm.asm`): This program calculates the Highest Common Factor (HCF) and Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers.

10. **Palindrome Check** (`palindrome_check.asm`): This program checks if a given string is a palindrome.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the ASM files.

3. Assemble and link the desired ASM program using an assembler such as NASM (Netwide Assembler) or TASM (Turbo Assembler).

4. Run the generated executable file to execute the ASM program.
